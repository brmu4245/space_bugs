A Micro:bit video game I developed to help show my classes the extent to the video capabilities.

In order to run this game the way it was intended, you will need the following:
- a microbit 
- a usb cord to connect the microbit to the computer
- a 3V or lower speaker (I used one from a birthday card given to me.)
- a 3v pressure sensor 
- 4 alligator clips
- (optional) the metal part of banana plugs... I find by using these, it doesn't wear the metal connections on the Microbit

How to get the code onto the Microbit:
1. Copy the lines from the text file.
2. Go to: https://python.microbit.org/v/2.0
3. Paste the code into the editor window.
4. Attach the Microbit to your computer using the USB cord.
5. Download the code onto your computer.
6. Open the folder the file was sent to after the download is finished.
7. Drag the file from the folder to the icon labeled "Microbit".

From there, the little yellow light should blink rapidly for a few seconds. When it's finished uploading to the Microbit, the game will automatically begin.

If you have any questions, comments, or would like to use my code for another project, please contact me at:
